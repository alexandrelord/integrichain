## What are the API advantages?

- APIs are a great way to share data and functionality between applications. 
- Automation: with APIs, computers can manage the work. Users can update workflows through APIs to make them quicker and more productive.
- Efficiency: APIs empower developers to be more productive by reusing code in complex but repetitive processes. 
- Adaptable: APIs can be used to integrate with other applications, which allows for more flexibility and customization.

## What is OpenAPI?

- OpenAPI defines a standard to describe, produce, consume, and visualize RESTful web services. 
- It's a specification standard for REST APIs that defines the structure and syntax.
- It is programming language agnostic, so it can be used with any programming language.

## Why should we use OpenAPI?

- Allows humans and computers to discover and understand the service's capabilities without access to source code, documentation, or network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. [source](https://swagger.io/specification/)


## What are SQLAlchemy advantages and disadvantages?

## What is Docker?

- Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.

## When should we use Docker?

- You should use Docker when you want to run an application in an isolated environment.
